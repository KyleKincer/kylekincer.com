# Kyle Kincer

Howdy! I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** at Sweetwater currently working on their CRM in [4D](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Concepts/about). I love building things with **Next.js**, **Rust**, **Python**, **Swift**, **Golang**, **TypeScript**, _and more_. I'm also a [**musician**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4akIP22tgc7IMBWKneUZwQ) and **photographer**.
