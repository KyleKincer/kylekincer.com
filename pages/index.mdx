# Kyle Kincer

Howdy! I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** at Sweetwater currently working on their CRM in [4D](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv18/4D/18.4/Introduction-to-the-4D-Language.300-5233646.en.html). I love building things with **Next.js**, **Rust**, **Python**, **Swift**, **Golang**, **TypeScript**, _and more_. I'm also a **musician** and **photographer**.
