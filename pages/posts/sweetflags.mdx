SweetFlags is a feature flag and config service built for speed, reliability, and a great developer experience. It allows for creating and managing feature flags and configurations for multiple apps and environments seamlessly. 

## API

The SweetFlags API is built using Express.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, and Redis to be maintainable and extremely fast. 

- MongoDB bring extremely fast read times and a flexible NoSQL structure, and Mongoose brings a great developer experience and enhanced maintainability. 
- Express.js is a familiar and flexible framework that allows SweetFlags to be as fast as humanly possible. 
- Redis caching makes retrieving feature flag states even faster.
